    description: `I completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, upon which I could apply fundamentals of data science using Python with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. I have also tried to work with Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, and SQL in data management. Finally, I also built machine learning models using Scikit-learn and covered advanced topics on SciPy optimization, Beautiful Soup web scraping, and Plotly visualizations. For the capstone project, this course focused on real-world data analysis with model evaluation. Further, I had a try at generative AI with GPT-3.5.`,

    description: `In this course, I was taught data analysis on Python. For handling the datasets, pandas and NumPy were used. For visualization, Matplotlib or Seaborn, Scikit-Learn were used for the regression models, and SciPy was employed for the optimization techniques. The final project was to predict house prices given some real estate data.`,
